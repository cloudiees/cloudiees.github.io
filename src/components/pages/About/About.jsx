                Hello, I'm Ibrahim! Currently I am pursing my bachelors in computer science (hopefully soon my masters) at UIC.
                <br/>
                There are 3 things I love, learning, gaming, and keyboards.
                <br/>
                Fun fact, through my sophomore and junior year along side my UIC classes I was taking also classes at my community college. You may ask, why? The reason is simple: I wanted to learn more stuff.
